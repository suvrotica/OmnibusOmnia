		blogContent={`Title:Memoir? 
	Date:2023-aug-9
	42br
I'm intent on keeping a memoir because I know that when I'm gone, there will be people wondering what music irritated me, what books I found annoying, and what defined this ludicrous audacity of a bengali black sheep. And I don't want to disappoint them.
But I'm really sort of doing this for myself; I could care less about the selfish progeny or their vicissitudes. This is really an exploration of the self; an unexamined life isn't justice done, and the halfway mark is about the right time for it, for it might be that you never get to see the other half.
42br
And I know I'll die soon, as my unpopularity is climbing and the cost of eliminating an unprotected Indian civilian is dropping precipitously to a point where I might just do it myself and save the gentlemen the ignominy. In fact, in the city of joy, if you're male and listed for murder and not high on the celebrity score, the average goon with self-respect may not even take my case. The minimum is rape; at least there's some fun involved, hilarity with friends, and a drunken shindig with colluding officers of law. 
42br
It was different in Hyderabad when I had the money. That image is a reconstruction of what the Hyderabad goon told my maid. He would cut me up into parts and put them in a shoe box or some sort of gift-wrapped box. She was scared and wept. But I just stitched the parts up and gave it life.
42br
What they'll do in city lovely is, I suspect, train a newbie to carelessly run a sharp fish knife through my intestines, spill it on the floor, and watch the trainee vomit and laugh up a hysteric storm of imprecations that would bring up my entire family, living and nonliving. There's very little change in the last name; I go from Ghosh to Ghost, if you believe such things.
42br

42bq("
I'm on glass and sand on a fruitless errand,
But I must persist to futility.
The paths well marked I refrain,
It's the shit stained leading out of the city.
42br
Holy my hole, my dick and balls,
Tied with a rubber band.
Masculinity I need on occasions,
Aloha colored grandstand.
42br
Hoping I score when I am no more,
When I am dead and long gone.
When people can spray piss all they want,
Or shoot shit on me a tonne.
42br
At least they'll know he lived a life full of life,
Filthy as a whore or worse in mind.
In his fantastic landscapes everything could be,
Surreal was an ordinary kind.

		blogContent={`Title:Omibus Omni
	Date:2023-jul-28
	42br
	I couldn't just flippantly, verbosely and ineloquently describe this blog as a scratchpad of
			thoughts, a much sought-after extension of my embarrassing tangle of nerves, unrelated fancies
			and figments strewn around and rattling loose in it, collectibles from the waste basket scraps
			that should have seen a shredder, or, somewhat more crudely, <b>everything</b> about
			<b>anything</b>. But these are <u>exactly</u> what I always wanted my blog to be. I'm not a prisoner
			to the usual boundaries that limit most people, and I wanted a place where a weirdo like me could
			find a way to read about the weird wanderings of a profligate traveling mind and not feel weird.
			42br
			In Latin, as a child, and used verbatim in bengali (অমনিবাস), I've seen the word "omnibus" used as if to mean a volume containing several novels or other items previously
			published separately. This usage likely comes from the idea of bringing together many works
			"for all" to enjoy, and that may be the real meaning, but I wanted to hold on to a fat book. And "omnia" expresses the idea of inclusiveness and
			universal provision, basically anything. So, in the end it's a fat book about anything, in a decorated way, lest people ignore it as a
			trifle and think I'm a fool, which I am, but I don't want people to know that right off the bat. Omnibus Omnia can't be intended as a omnibus, albeit fat and with a name suggesting such, but perhaps as a svelte universal melting pot of
			quixotic ideas, and, if I'm allowed some more big words, wisdom! Just by keeping the book 
			open, or the website, this wide-ranging consortium, will allow me to test the limit of the ever-expanding horizon, 
every conceivable topic and field of inquiry as a beacon of diverse and inclusive
			discourse and so on, or at least fill your mind with the noise that worries me. I can get a bit carried away, sometimes. And furthermore both words have the all powerful "omni" often used as a prefix in English words to convey the idea of being all-encompassing or universal, like Omniscient: "Omni" + "scient" (knowing) = "All-knowing," referring to having infinite knowledge or awareness or Omnipotent: "Omni" + "potent" (powerful) = "All-powerful," suggesting having unlimited or supreme power, or Omnipresent: "Omni" + "present" (existing or being everywhere) = "Present everywhere," indicating the ability to be everywhere at once. 
These remind people of god, but remind me that I'm always full of shit, and unless there's a loo near, the civilization is in imminent danger of what's inside me. And I like that one version of the bangali word omni (অমনি) meaning is -for no reason or -like that, captures my sentiment well.
			42br
			Here, ¡Ay, caramba! I'm free to explore the vast as well as the forbidden realms of human feats and foibles, fucks and farts, feces and fraternities and by holy golly in bengali, 
			jai maa kali (জয় মা কালী), like Tennyson's Ulysses and his mariners, if you as a reader come on this journey, sharing and
			receiving insights on a stage that questions our assumptions and where the answers always lead
			to more thrilling journeys. So whether you're a seasoned someone or a curious commoner, an
			artist or an amateur, a ponderer or a pragmatist, join me in the infinite mosaic of collective
			wisdom we have to explore. Welcome to Omnibus Omnia.
			42br
			42bq("Though much is taken, much abides; and though...We are not now that strength which in old
			days... Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are—...One equal temper of heroic
			hearts,...Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will...To strive, to seek, to find, and
			not to yield.")

	Date:2023-aug-2
42br
The "Popcorn Song" is a catchy instrumental tune originally composed by Gershon Kingsley in 1969. It gained popularity in the 1970s and became widely recognized as a fun, upbeat melody. The song's playful, repetitive nature made it a favorite for dance performances and has been covered and remixed by various artists over the years. Its title reflects the resemblance of the synth sounds to popping popcorn, giving it a unique and memorable quality.

42pic("Rec2.jpg")
Some of these relate to me because I was born in 1975. And most ears wouldn't be able to, unless they're as old as mine or nostalgically tuned. These were on two sides of a 45 rpm record.
I had a crush on a girl called Tuktuki, and these early gramophone records—the Philips record player, the DIY amplifier my uncle made, and this girl's face—my uncle's house in Ballygunge, Kolkata, and my innocent imaginations and expectations of how the world would be all come back to me when I listen to this track. I had lots of hope then. I don't now. I am even more limited than that weak, infatuated boy. These visits were too infrequent; I was too bookish, too much of a nerd, and my family background was too obviously lower middle-class, the class that her family was trying desperately to show that they were not by being in a more affluent habitat and with their dress and manners, and she did look the part. Her sister was much nicer than her; she was much better wife material, I thought. Her name was Alubhate, a moniker given by my uncle because her nose was flat like a Japanese girl, and her nature was dilute and vegetarian like boiled rice and potatoes, as opposed to non-vegetarian, stunning, spicy redhot curry that would not only look good on the plate but also sizzle audibly to make your status known and also make you stay up all night and burn your asshole. But Alubhate was full of life and gregarious, and it was Tuktuki who was given to dark moods and despondence. Usually it was her that I ended up talking to when I went there trying to talk to the more sharp-nosed sister.

		blogContent={`Title:My crushing poverty
	Date:2023-aug-14
42br
The crushing poverty I continue to experience in these years is not only a statement of financial accounting but also of human nature—the deplorable way in which I see we treat each other by one artificially created difference or another, by color of something or the other: skin/hair/eye/teeth, by law, by religion, by caste, by money, by power, by clothes, by mannerism, by language, by accent, by locality, by preference of brands, by superstition, by the smell of farts, or by any means necessary.
42br
The hubris of all our proud accommodations is just mere fiction, and that's why it's so easy for those in the scam business to do so well, as long as you can act the part as if you are the part. Right now, India is the land of fraudsters, freeloaders, and freaks. They come with zero real material, but with acting and gaslighting, for all practical purposes, everything else can be arranged or stretched, just like my sphincter.
42br
As it so happens, all I really care about is a night of restful sleep, a decent session of sh*t, and just some quiet time with my own mind. And I like it when the turd is so large that you think the world's going to end, but eventually the sphincter manages to stretch to that ludicrous monstrosity, and the world's saved. But occasionally. Only occasionally.

		blogContent={`Title:The Perseids 
	Date:2023-aug-13
42br
The Perseids are one of the most popular meteor showers of the year. They are active every year from mid-July to late August, but they peak on August 12-13. This year, the peak will be on August 13, 2023.
The Perseids are named after the constellation Perseus. This is because the meteors appear to come from the direction of the constellation Perseus. The radiant of the Perseids is located in the constellation Perseus, near the Double Cluster.
42br
The name Perseus is derived from the Greek word "Perseidai", which means "sons of Perseus". In Greek mythology, Perseus was a hero who killed the Gorgon Medusa. He is also the father of Andromeda, who was saved from a sea monster by Perseus.
42br
The Perseids are caused by Earth passing through the debris left behind by Comet Swift-Tuttle. This comet orbits the Sun every 133 years. When Earth passes through the comet's debris trail, the particles collide with our atmosphere and burn up, creating meteors.
42br
The Perseids are known for their bright and fast meteors. They can often be seen streaking across the sky at speeds of up to 60 miles per second. Some Perseids can even be bright enough to be seen during the day.
42br
This year, the Perseids will be visible in the Northern Hemisphere. The best time to see them is after midnight, when the radiant (the point in the sky where the meteors appear to come from) is high in the sky. If you have a dark sky, you can expect to see up to 100 meteors per hour during the peak.
42br
Some tips for viewing the Perseids:
42br
* Find a dark location with a clear view of the sky.<br>
* Get away from city lights and streetlights.<br>
* Lie on your back and look up at the sky.<br>
* Be patient and wait for the meteors to appear.<br>
* If you have a telescope, you can use it to see the meteors more closely.<br>
42br
The Perseids are a beautiful sight to behold. If you have the chance to see them, I highly recommend it.
42br
In addition to the Perseids, there are three other major meteor showers each year:
42br
* The Quadrantids: This shower peaks on January 4. It is the most active meteor shower of the year, with up to 200 meteors per hour.<br>
* The Lyrids: This shower peaks on April 22. It is known for its faint meteors, but it can still be a beautiful sight.<br>
* The Leonids: This shower peaks on November 17. It is known for its fireballs, which are large and bright meteors.<br>

Here is a schedule of the best times to see the Perseids in Kolkata:

August 13, 2023: After midnight<br>
August 14, 2023: 1:00 AM to 4:00 AM<br>
August 15, 2023: 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM<br>

	Date:2023-aug-6
42br
The other day, my mom asked me if coffee had shit in it. This isn't the sort of thing my mom's interested in, but apparently the misinformation channel she watches has recently decided to misinform their viewers on stuff they use every day. Well, for common, everyday coffee, the answer is no.
42br
The only coffee that you would hear shit brought up is kopi luwak, also known as civet coffee. It's a type of coffee made from coffee beans that have been eaten and then excreted by a civet, a small nocturnal mammal. The beans are collected from the feces, cleaned, and then processed to produce coffee. It's considered one of the most expensive coffees in the world due to its unique production process. However, there are ethical concerns about the treatment of civets on some coffee plantations, so it's essential to ensure its sourcing is ethical and sustainable if you choose to try it. As this isn't really the civet's choice of meal or habitat, once we found out the beans in their shit were tasty, their future was fucked forever.
42br
In birds, including chickens, both eggs and shit are expelled through the cloaca, the bird version of the swiss-army asshole, a common opening for eggs, piss, and shit in birds. The egg is formed in the chicken's reproductive system and travels through the oviduct before being laid through the cloaca. But in the end, eggs, piss, and shit do come out through the same opening in chickens, which is something to think about.

In India, the types of people who can aspire to upward mobility are: Long-tongued ungulates who can walk on two legs and speak Hindi; concentric assholes who are fluid with the nefarious political science needed to maintain the Hindu state of the present day, pretending it's based on the teachings of the past, used and reused; even refused douchbags who perform the general administration and filler paperwork of smudging the truth; permanently dull and blank ambitionless morons who give the appearance of volume by headcount; pedigreed Hindu fanatics who know nothing of the faith except that it's some other faith; and are disguised wellbred goons.
42br
Most of us, in the prime of whatever it is we are supposed to be in the prime of, have no idea why about most things we pretend a familiarity in everyday life, even when it's our bona fide bread, and secure that this layer of abstraction or ignorance won't hurt us, we go about our business, expanding it, ultimately until we have no idea how anything works anymore and we're going about our business at the mercy of various fancy lookup services. Now that I'm sort of mad, I don't know what I'm supposed to look up. What's the lookup service for looking up lookup services? When you're mad, when a lot of stuff you've written that doesn't have a backup is gone, I guess you just pick your shit up where you left off, that's really all I can do. If I can salvage any from memory or scraps, I will. Happy restart to me!

The bulbous amoral tumors in their souls.

Not trampling on any dead thing.

My face bright with what might.
Full fart ahead, I run until I'm dead,

Ode to peace is just "Toodaloo".

He licked all the wrong holes, so,

Hide behind stickers and glue. 
I'll make them wear short pink frocks, 
To do spastic dance for you.

The softy cocks hide in the dark,

I can't state firmly enough, and now I can't grit my teeth with the cavity pain, that most people I've encountered in my life are assholes. Had I not gone to the US and not picked up this word, I'm sure I would have settled for the sanguine son of a swine in vernacular that my father, in his last years, had made a staple in every sentence except for the reading of the Gita in the morning.
42br
People with a full stomach without bloating, irascible intestinal worms that have retired after their meal, malignant tumors in full remission, a sufficient positive bank balance that they can afford to forget to count, and a deaf and dumb wife who is also blind wouldn't understand the need for the belligerence I feel.
42br
My problems are different, of course; I am a different beast, with different pubic hair and naturally occurring lice of other species. I am, in fact, an alien, as I sometimes feel. Sure, I pucker my asshole and snake a turd just like the rest of the shithole homo sapiens, but there's something different about me. Sure, I piss and play with my piss like the rest of the retarded generation, but I sense a satisfaction that's missing in them. It is most likely that I am a retarded fuck who should just shut up and keep to himself, which is what I do.
42br
But one day I'm going to be a Bengali Babu,or at least dress up as one again, and go to some asshole's wedding if they invite me. I haven't been to anyone's wedding for such a long time. Shit, and at the rate I'm losing teeth, I'll have none left before I get invited to one. Well, probably I'll die before long. Who's going to invite a carcass to a wedding?
42br
Too bad the Bengali race aren't rapists by profession. I mean, the dress sort of lends a helping hand. Just take your schlong out and do your job. Other than that, you could be a professional pisser or shitter. It's very roomy in there, in the dhoti, but not very athletic. It gets in the way if you want to do some elaborate factory work; the parts of the dhoti will get into the machine and pull you into the rolling contraption.
42br
No wonder the race isn't really up to any good and has earned its reputation as lazy. It all started with the fucking choice of attire; the forefathers should've known better. But they were probably just wankers, happy to get the dick out at a moment's notice, which is what mattered the most to them, and fuck the podgy foremothers. The assholes—don't you just love them? They look so cute side by side in those black and white pictures.

	Date:2023-aug-4
42br
The newly erected kingdom of India, as it were, is not one of castles, knights, and dragons. Not of facilities, education, healthcare, or employment. No, this kingdom is one of spirit, a shared identity among the shaggy masses who laud the mustachioed hooligans of yesteryear, long before the introduction of the rule of law. Watersports for people of lower castes seem to have about the right amount of silliness for such a realm. This week was filled with celebratory hullabaloo.
42br
This Mustachioed Hooliganity is not quite anarchy, if their press is to be believed, but a throwback to an earlier time, when gods roamed the streets. Anarchy is for young, naive souls who believe in freedom, usually the opposition, minorities, atheists, lower vulgarities, and other obscenities that have not yet discovered how much hard work it takes for the appointed goons to keep them in their place. No, the Hooliganity is, in essence, a kingdom built upon the shoulders of the many mustachioed precedents of the past. Whereas these nitwits that complain descend from disgruntled natives who had done the hard work of civil disobedience and other forbidden acts so that the current generation shouldn't have to, but still do.
42br
The rule of law has always been a tricky thing, especially when you consider that laws are essentially just words scrawled on a piece of parchment by someone long dead who probably had a lot more hair, teeth, optimism, and significantly fewer piles than the present generation and knew less. The hooligans circumvent the obscure parts by not consulting and are hailed as heroes in this kingdom, celebrated for their rambunctious spirit, captured in many a media tale, and their prodigious facial hair, revered in daily mustache-growing debates.
42br
In the Mustachioed Hooliganity, there is an order in the disorder. Here, chaos is a friend, the ever-intrusive guest who shows up at the most inconvenient of times and won't leave until it has turned your world upside down, especially when your money stops working overnight. There's always a post-hoc postmortem offered, usually outrageous, even comical, but straight from Moses. These hooligans live by the commandment: If it's good for the leaders and doesn't kill me right away, it's probably okay'. This is the rule of the mustachioed thumb, permanently stuck up the rears of the citizens who like it. The kingdom of the holy goon-mongers wouldn't have it any other way.

	Date:2023-aug-4
42br
When Yuval says AI is an alien, he's only saying that to drive home a bigger point: that we may not be seeing the bigger picture, not that there's an actual alien intelligence in there. I'm sure he knows these are still pretty early machine language models trained on data that's not alien but human, and hence all permutations in that space are also human, albeit stranger to us if pieced together strangely.
42br
He is also stressing it metaphorically in the sense that we have scarcely begun to understand AI. And this is the real danger: not understanding how the higher dimensions are working out some of the more abstract problems and being okay with that. It's important we first figure this out before we continue its use, because here lies the trouble: this isn't just an ordinary black box anymore; it's Pandora's box.
42br
We've opened Pandora's box, and at least we should attempt to understand and mitigate the inevitable and yet unintentional series of harmful consequences. Pandora's box is a mythological artifact from Greek mythology. The gods gave Pandora a box and told her not to open it. Curiosity got the better of her, and she eventually opened it, releasing all the evil into the world. Only hope remained inside the box.
I can't understand how ChatGPT will help the billions in the world that live in "some sort" of civilization that is decrepit enough to keep them starving or in atrocious economic situations where they live like Homo erectus without access to electricity or amenities. And even with that basic demand met, several people cannot afford education or do not have the wherewithal to get to a point where they can form the question structures necessary to ask GPT for any help. Or to comprehend its reply.
42br
I also fail to understand why the working population, on the other hand, thinks of it as a competitor. It is no more a competitor than an educated, privileged man. The fight is going to be mostly amongst people who are already in countries of privilege or on a career path where either the smarts or confabulations of a smarter metal coworker can be utilized.
42br
The Cobb-Douglas production function is a widely used model that describes the relationship between inputs (such as labor and capital) and outputs in the production process. A simplified version of the function is typically represented as:
42br
Q = A * L^a * K^b
42br
where Q is output, L is labor, K is capital, A is a constant representing total factor productivity, and a and b are the labor and capital shares, respectively.
42br
When artificial intelligence (AI) is introduced in a hypothetical production process, say, it can lead to an increase in the productivity of labor, which would in turn increase the output per unit of labor. This increase in productivity can be modeled as an increase in the A constant in the above equation.
42br
However, the introduction of AI can also affect the demand for different types of labor. For example, if AI is able to perform certain tasks more efficiently than human labor, the demand for those types of jobs may decrease. This can be modeled using other equations, such as the substitution elasticity equation. That's not a silver lining; it's just how a competitive environment works: you lose some jobs and gain others.
42br
It's not my misanthropic take alone, I hope,that there's not a lot of egalitarianism in any of these introductions, just ways to make some corporations richer, not the fate or fetters of the abandoned millions, who are suffering excruciating silly ends because we're not using technology for the good.
42br
Sometimes people have to do their own thinking. If they leave it all to artificial intelligence, we've arrived at a roundabout with our own crippled sense of misdirection. Just another instance of selfish self-congratulatory focus on an advantage that, if used properly, can really help the world.
42br
Anyway, another rant. At least its burden is off my mind.

	Date:2023-aug-3
42br
Words like "malaria," "sunrise," and "heartfelt" reveal our past ignorance of science. "Malaria" comes from the Italian phrase "mal'aria," or "bad air," as people once thought the disease came from swamp air. We now know it's caused by mosquitoes. "Sunrise" and "sunset" are terms people use to describe the sun moving around the earth, even though it's actually the earth rotating. And "heartfelt" refers to emotions believed to come from the heart, even though we know they originate in the brain. 
42br
The fact that we survive the meaninglessness of these words reminds us how far we've come in our understanding of the world and yet do not really know anything about it. That there is an inner core of working parts that keeps us alive and an outer layer of indifference, oblivion, and comical irony. This outer layer is where most of us live, even the educated ones, because they're really half baked; they're just reading a script without really getting into the shit, the history of it all, or getting down and dirty. Sort of a funny twilight zone that people like to live in,with religion and other sorts of bullshit stuck halfway through their asshole.
42br
Even in these almost slum-like shanty towns in the boondocks of Kolkata, where I live, electricity isn't an issue. And guess what? People cook with an induction cooker; it's no longer a luxury item in a slum. Could Michael Faraday have foreseen such a day? I survive on bread and tea on some days, but what bread? Brown bread that's fortified with everything that the homo sapiens had to run miles to get that rupee few can get me at the nearest tea stall. And I don't have allergies anymore; the air is full of fortified filth that gives me the immunity to be not just careful but clairvoyant. Even at the pauper stage of my personal existence, I'm surrounded by conveniences that the greatest of kings didn't live to see. What a time to not be dead yet!
42br
Most people walk through life cavalier about the miracles of invention and the hard work of many scientists, who may not have been scientists as we understand them today but devout religious people of faith or philosophers who had only begun to decipher parts of the puzzle or get mankind's large bulbous head out of its ass. But now, after all these years, we are too self-involved and devoid of the need to peer into the questions because the pressures have gone, or peer back into the ass urgently as in some religious countries. The desire to know is only kindled in a few who, like me, are quickly cast out of society because they don't fit in. We like the time before we become outcasts, with a meager few who hesitantly follow, usually for the wrong reasons.
42br
So these days I let a mosquito settle down without the practiced belligerence that we've been taught. Mommy mosquitoes need blood to lay their eggs. After she takes a blood meal, she uses the protein and iron from the blood to produce eggs. Without that, nothing—imagine how significant we are.
42br
Daddy mosquitoes, on the other hand, in a way that human gung-ho males may not identify today, don't need blood and mainly feed on nectar and other plant sugars. Without them, this bloody mommy and sweet daddie, a gap in the ecosystem as a source of food for other animals would eventually get us extinct.

	People who only say confident things and give off a gleaming appearance of positivity are usually overcompensating for their insecurities. They have to hide behind an always-smiling or piss-waterfall sort of facade because they think it's wrong to be comfortable with their insecurities. But from experience, I know the best way to deal with life is head-on. Difficulties and failures are a part of everyone's lives and businesses as well. Wearing colored goggles and burying one's head in the sand never helped; you have a dry throat and a fluttering sphincter that's always seeking the wrong kind of attention, right when you can't afford it. I have a clear-eyed, rational, and practical worldview that helps me weigh the pros and cons without bias. and that's really key. I used to carry toilet paper wherever I went in India when I first came back from the US, but now I use my hands. Sometimes I just let the shit dry on my ass.
42br
Most overconfident corporate male fucks are usually effeminate; at home they sit on their mom's or wife's lap, trembling, mumbling, and drooling from the mouth, some in tears, the henpecked rascals, and in the office they are royal fucking Bengal tigers. There are various forms of psychopathy that are exhibited in the genteel, still air of the corporate theater. Sort of a mini-kingdom within itself that runs its own obscene autocracy. The ones who shout imprecations are thus a product of a country and this corporate culture that have a habit of cherry-picking what they want. We can't pick the part of the world that's good, but we can inculcate the bad, just with a veneer of everything being alright when it is not, simply because that's what we do everywhere else. The corporate world is just a regular mini version of the bullshit in greater society.

Unrealistic expectations often lead to unhealthy outcomes. It's better to plan properly and go step by step; rushing into decisions with blinkers on isn't the best way to go about a venture. I've felt the headwinds, I understand the stakes and the pitfalls, and I advise people to be cautious. Either being ill-advised, led by charlatans, or suffering from Dunning and Kruger, the gung-ho usually end up badly. In India, there's a chain of people who pretend to know their shit when they don't, which complicates things.
42br
Productivity is a term that's become trite through abuse and overuse. Once upon a time, it meant doing more in less time when the devices and tasks were clearly mismatched. But now, it's just a sneaky way for companies to extract more sweat from their employees for less pay. You'd think how convenient it would be for them, but not really, especially when there's a whole industry built around exploiting one group of people at the behest of another. Again, when you trust a group of humans to do the right thing, please expect the opposite. Otherwise, you haven't learned a thing. The idea is to know this and survive. I haven't; I have a big mouth, and I want to be fair. There's no place for a stupid person like me.
42br
It's a bleak reality that the average worker is expected to do more with less. Overburdened, stressed, and undervalued, it's a wonder how anyone manages to survive the daily grind. And for what? to produce subpar products and services that barely scrape by? Work, once a source of fulfillment, has been reduced to just a means to an end and a bragging social membership badge. It's no longer about creating something of value or making a difference in the world. It's just a necessary evil, something to endure in exchange for a paycheck, or an ego badge for oneself or another—a membership. The irony of it all is that the very definition of productivity has become a reflection of its opposite. In this dystopian world of distorted productivity where greed and exploitation reign supreme, where work is a chore and employees are just disposable resources, the so-called progress has taken us backwards. It's a sorry state of affairs, but who needs dignity and respect anyway? If we can get money, that's really all we need, isn't it?
42br
People find many reasons not to pay after you spend hours on an assignment or report; the ones that I've encountered are: The project was postponed, or it was canceled, or it didn't get funded, or the usual, we knew it already, or the more humorous, this is all information that's available from the internet, as if I were to manufacture fresh baked bread with grains grown from my own backyard to qualify. As I note, people are assholes, not to be trusted. If you have burned your fingers in a flame once, the only thing you can do is not keep repeating it, because otherwise you'll have no fingers left.
42br
It is time for companies and employers to understand that bona fide productivity, even though that particular word is just gassy vomit, comes from investing in their employees, providing them with the tools and resources they need to do their jobs well, and valuing their contributions so they feel part of a bigger, more meaningful picture.
42br
And, and this can't be overstated, you have to be paying them a living wage, or don't fucking waste anyone's time. As the genie Index shows us, this isn't happening, and the gap is extreme. At some point, if this goes on, the people who pay for the goods—the middle class—are going to go below the threshold, without a way to exist or pay to live in this world. It is time for us to work together, to support one another, and to create a world where work is meaningful and people are treated with respect and dignity. The future depends on it, and you can't run away from the future; it's coming at you.

	Date:2023-aug-1
	42br
42bq("
City of my dream, twisted it seems,
Like my fantasies from before.
The gridlock of bricks, wooden sticks,
No humans living there anymore. 
42br
Or even if they are, they're alien,
They don't know their neighbor still. 
A comparative enmity of thinking, 
A pervasive feeling of ill will.
42br
The sky plain, the sun or rain,
The cycles keep shiny the sheen. 
Future comes and melts into past,
The present in the city between.
42br
My life as I look back in foggy glass, 
A childhood spent in awe.
The package of gods and goddesses,
Heaven's hilarious bribery law.
42br
It wasn't really the dark clouds,
That were unpleasantly bright. 
The rainbows were talking to me,
I hushed them to be quiet. 
42br
But the unquiet grew, and now it's loud,
The voices have sinews and force.
The nights descend every now and then,
The nightmares are my source. 
42br
Welled up anger, signs of danger, 
A simmering caldera of furious force. 
On the surface a placid lake,
A baby duck taking a swimming course. 
42br
Impending doom, the fear and gloom,
The anxiety and depression of being. 
Hardly anything at all I have,
To deal with what I am not seeing. 
42br
Waning my mind, weak the bind,
With reality as I knew as a child. 
Now the games are up,
Weeds growing everywhere are wild.
42br
A nagging unsettling doom looms,
Awake, a futile sisyphian thankless task.
A morbid shadow long hands outstretched, 
To pour life into life's ghoulish mask.
42br
Everything that I knew has somehow morphed, 
Into something that doesn't recognize me. 
I don't exist for the reality that I perceive, 
I imagine how beautiful it all could be.

42bq("I get in the pool, to get cool,
Lately the heat is getting really hot.
And when I swim, hit by whim,
I poop when I like a particular spot.
42br
I may be a hairy guy, I'm very very shy,
My asshole quivering with lust.
Or at times, an untimely fart, 
Pushes a few turds with the thrust. 
42br
I'm very smart, hastily depart, 
People think it's someone else.
The bubbles in the gas, foul stench it has,
Break on the surface with the smell. 
42br
Sometimes the turds float, a brownish coat, 
Of slippery slime that glisten in the sun.
People get very sick, the water very thick, 
Defecation can be just so much fun.
42br
Now I don't know, that pool I cannot go,
The water is a rank smelling goop,
You can't move a bit, full of puke and spit,
The unkindness shown to my poop.
42br
Today the sun is hot, I'm pissed in my cot,
The heat is just overbearing. 
I'll ignore the scum, my pool here I come, 
A little diarrhea will sundry smiles bring. 
42br
Doom scrolling nerds, will order my turds, 
The greatest psychedelic there is.
On bulk purchase, per ten kilo case,
I'll add a gallon of warm foamy piss.
42br
How I want to shit, in massive amounts that is,
To fill the whole fucking sea.
Next nobel prize, you wouldn't be surprised, 
Surely must come to me.
42br
Darkness in my soul has colored my shit like coal,
But I'm really very fond of my shit.
The smoke in my poot, smells just like soot,
Twilight is so mysteriously unlit.
42br
Climate change is here, my shit everywhere, 
How cool is that to boot.
Mother nature as bitch, indecorous climate witch, 
Getting badly burned by their poot.
42br
Dear fucking god, I'm a cheerless sod,
Don't let this heat fuck my ass.
Constipated as hell, I'll ring your heaven's bell,
I'm so full of shit and gas.

How we grit our teeth and think of ways we won't, can't, or shan't, how we all secretly desire a flaming death to the end of everything around us, except just us. Of civilization. We'd rather be in the trees, except now we've cut them down. Or we'd complain that the entertainment isn't all that we thought it would be and that the asshole is extra itchy, or that we crave sugary drinks, the corruption in our hearts, the bullshit at the core of civilization, and that it's really the weirdness we miss most of all.

I like cunts of every kind.

Sink my teeth into the rind.

The land of the free, holy the chopped tree,
The men of oil rule, who think.
The weakest link honest men,
Their balls have shit that stink.

Jesus doth knoweth, how shit will floweth,
Once we shit in their brain.
The wise disappoint me everyday,
Power drain, vain utter shit stain.

Let us say our prayers well and dwell,
Take servant girls and slap sense into them.
Fuck them for they know not, 
What it is to swallow god's oily semen.

Verily thus us, goodly we go, 
And fuck with impunity the crust. 
The rituals are rote, a boat on the money moat, 
Must be safe for in god we trust.

Fuck brown, the black, and the china men. 
Jesus land is only alabaster white,
Of the white, for the white, by the white, amen.

Title:Selfie
Date:2023-jul-29
42br
I don't like taking selfies. It rubs everything that's wrong with the world against the very grains of my nature. I don't have any need to see myself in a frame, just to remind the constantly agitated, anxious, narcissistic demon inside that I already exist. He knows. He takes great pains to remind me of that.
42br
The fusiform face area is locked in the fusiform gyrus, which is part of the temporal lobe in our brain, involved in recognizing "other" faces. The area responsible for processing and recognizing our own face is the self-face area in the right hemisphere of the brain, particularly the right occipital cortex and the right fusiform gyrus. As may be the case, mine may not be working right. I see a demon, a worm, or something ghastly in the face that's supposed to be me—not literally, but I get the feeling I'm looking at something disgusting.
42br
The insular cortex processes gustatory disgust in mammals, things like reactions to poisonous, foul taste, and smell, and interestingly, in us, moral disgust. Emotional reactions are processed in the amygdala.
These areas are involved in generating and processing negative emotions and reactions, and various factors, including self-perception, body image, self-esteem, or personal insecurities in my case, make the gargoyle looking back from the photograph not the epitome of the kind of person the sensitive asshole inside me expects. I recognize that self-image and self-perception can be complex, and insecure maniacs may have varying emotional reactions to their own appearance in photos.

Title:Elon isn't evil
Date:2023-jul-29
42br
I don't think Elon is evil, the Twitter fiasco notwithstanding.
42br
I'm sort of worried that if it ever came to it that a face-reading device would be invented, mine would fare worse than his. I mean, look at him. What's there not to like? But generally, as a nerd, I am partial to and incredibly proud of Elon. If you think about the stuff he's doing today—electric cars, robots that can pretend to be like us, rockets, tunnels, going to space or Mars, solving problems like superhumans—and close your eyes and imagine someone else, you wouldn't have to think very far. The people that he represents or the pristine imagination that he preserves are those of children and adolescents: The little people that are dismissed in everyday conversations as frivolity of no consequence, who need to be indoctrinated to bullshit faith or half-baked education handed down in jails called schools
42br
This I know because I belong to that pariah tribe too, never taken seriously, but my musings are just a bit too confusing or x-rated—not the kind of x that Elon likes, to be clear. That belongs to René Descartes, the French mathematician and father of analytical geometry. He popularized x as the symbol for an unknown quantity in mathematics in his publication "La Géométrie" in 1637. That must have been the inspiration. That's how he thinks. His first-principles thinking involves questioning and deconstructing assumptions to arrive at the most basic and essential elements of a problem, rather than relying on analogies or accepting conventional wisdom.
42br
He's trying to do the right thing, and it's hard to keep a balance in all of this given that he has to put up with the worst examples of men and then smile and say he's a fan, etcetera. I'm sure he pukes his guts out to balance his four humors. These cretins are lucky to have been born in the same century. I know how hard it is to be an entrepreneur; it's harder to be a successful one and then be so successful that people get jealous and want you to fail. That's a club that's clueless, and I don't subscribe to that. The moral fusion of technology and man isn't a job for one man or one century, but I'd be the first to sign up if he's looking for a disposable and despicable human to implant a chip. At least I'll be able to articulate what the transhuman experience is like.
42br
He is human and prone to err, like we, wee. And that's that, only that I hope he's more sensitive to his footprint, not just his carbon; now that he's a giant, his movements cause grave upheavals in the lives of the mere ordinary, many like us, the silly shit crumbs, who lead miserable, meaningless, woeful lives and are hanging on tenuously to this precarious, slimy, rich man's cum-soaked rock with an uncertain and increasingly highly underappreciated grip, trying to eke out our low-budget lives, love or what little we get in this life, and laugh or at least provide the salubrious fodder for providing it for the rich.
42br
42pic("noodle.svg")It's generally the divide between the billionaires and the rest of humanity, and generally the collective as a whole, that worries my shit gray. Probably the only species that has fiction that's strong enough to make insubstantial more important to the point that it's a pathology, Affluenza: Money is a false arbitrator, just like melanin, but we don't seem to think that there's anything ugly about letting capitalism get away with this asymmetry or carry on with it with impunity. The ramifications aren't easy to understand, and it easily twists the noodles when I cook and think, but I like noodles. They're cheap, or at least the only thing that's been a consistent source of nourishment in this very wrapped-up, unequal, and packaged world that I can afford on my ex-gratia.

Title:Can't sleep
Date:2023-jul-29
42br
Sometimes I can't sleep at night, and I stare into the darkness until it thins.
42br
I like these early, very early hours of the morning. There's a sense of pervasive potential; the previous day is history, and the moments next are full of new things, unpredictable, unprecedented, and unplanned, mostly beyond our control, but while we can't wash off unpleasantness in a foreboding, we are always in a unique situation in the history of the universe, very lucky to be the ones with the powers of imagination and with a very fortunate and astronomically large chance to be here, given all the probabilities we have beat to get here.
42br
At these moments, I remember how lucky we all are, and if we are aware of even a bit of how miraculously improbable everything is, we will be able to focus on the meaningful parts of our existence, and the superficial, make-believe, thin artificial world will hurt us less. I say this, and I know I keep saying it.
42br
There's a tendency to repeat in everything we do, and I see that in my writing as well, not in any way that I think is worthwhile in and of itself but that it adds emphasis to who I am, a worry-wort nobody, who can type on his phone, and irritate the honorable sensibilities of good citizens the world over. As a saint, you do saintly things over and over, not occasionally; if you're a bore, you're always boring; if you're an asshole, you get my point. That's really what defines a human, or at least by definition: we are consistent, even in our limitations.
42br
I fear that the new breed of transhumans may be an entirely different story—a saint who's an asshole, extremely boring, and a hypocrite! Wait, we already have too many of them here in India; we don't need bots for that, but maybe there are other combinatorial manifestations, and for them, the books will have to be rewritten. A politician who's a criminal and has a history of pathological issues trying to stay honest—what's that? There's no need for that either. I'm sure we'll find junior positions for them as trainees. If you need to put corruption in machine learning form, India is definitely the IT hub of choice for Elon Musk. Imagine how useful these algorithms will be in disrupting democracy the world over, given that the training was accomplished under the supervision of the super-holy mother of democracy.
You might think it's okay, but religious or casteist irrationality creeps into policies as excuses, and soon what starts with sweet-smelling incense and warm candlelight is thick bamboo inserted into your rectum until it comes out through your mouth, and once impaled, it's too late to talk, debate, or complain. Like the sham democracy, you have installed one more pernicious evil that's going to squish your balls painfully slowly until you're dead, or enrolled as just another willing yes boy of the propaganda that's foisted.
42br
Thankfully, no one's paying any attention to what I'm writing; otherwise, they'd be worried like me and spend sleepless nights waiting for dawn, which thankfully does always arrive, albeit a tad early for some, depending on when you went to bed or what you have to do getting out of bed.
For me, usually that's taking a shit, and worrying some more, until the shit dries into flakes or I feel like getting up and making myself a cup of tea.
42br
And if you are, that is, paying attention, watch this documentary by Richard Dawkins based loosely on his book the god delusion:

Will get into your food and then.
A piece of me in molecules if be,
Will control the shit stain of your brain.

Into the piece of shit you are.
Full of fear, foolishness and fuck,
The shit homo hemlock fucking scar.

Date:2023-jul-28
42br
You may ask, if you're interested in asking, or in the general habit of annoying shit like that, what's the use of boasting about civilization if in a metropolis an itty bitty mosquito bite can fuck you up? Well, you've come to the right place. Not that I have any idea, but I'm exactly the kind of therapeutic vomit that would have close to an answer. You see, we're free to call ourselves whatever; that word civilization is just a word; it's a placeholder. Mostly a catch-all for mischievous logic, to spin shit up for naive people to just be happy with the superficial patina of paint that's put on, the shiny mascara, and stay listening to the grinning platitudinous bullshit of the soulless spinners of shit, who sugarcoat their spit before they rain it on your face. And then fart. 
Not the rustic, smelly one, but the imported, pretentious, perfumed one, full of floral signatures that burn the image of a clogged but plump rectum and puckering sphincter of a blonde French girl into the retina of your closed, lower-middle-class, and soon-to-be donated eyes after the dengue death.
42br
In Kolkata or in other cities in India, healthcare isn't a priority for the people you thought you had elected through a fair process of democratic elections. No, none of that. That's a fucked up fairy tale that went tits up after the first few magic years. These imbeciles, I mean respected politicians, sit on a sofa and simply spend the tenured years surrounded by nodding sycophants who lick their shit-oozing assholes and get nothing done except ensuring their bullshit family and friends get ahead in life or their political group. As a result, the issues that were there before they came to power only fester and multiply, and the superficial cover-ups suppress flare-ups temporarily, but are vomited and revomited as success stories by the media which again is a whore, that only cares about profit and government support. Since in a democracy like ours accountability is zero and feedback isn't allowed, the assholes have a free reign—I mean the mosquitoes.
42br
You get bitten, you're fucked and on your own.
Dengue fever can progress to severe forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which can be life-threatening, so don't fuck around if it gets bad. I'm saying that because I know I won't have an option. The free public hospitals (likely apocryphal) aren't places where you go to get cured; you go there to catch something more communicable, stand in long queues, or find out how low humans have sunk, especially the rancid Bengali race. In private hospitals, only the most expensive are professional, and the mosquitoes that'll bite me probably won't be paying enough compensation to go there because otherwise I can't afford it.

For those who want to know about dengue, here's a brief overview:

The term "dengue" has an interesting etymology and a complex history that dates back centuries. The word "dengue" is from the Swahili phrase "ki denga pepo," which translates to "evil spirit caused cramp-like seizure." This reflects the initial belief among locals in East Africa that malevolent spirits or supernatural forces caused the symptoms of the disease.
Over the centuries, dengue continued to cause periodic outbreaks in various regions, including Asia, Africa, and North America. It gained different names in different places, such as "breakbone fever" in the Caribbean and "dandy fever" in Europe.
The first known recorded outbreak of dengue-like symptoms occurred in China during the Jin Dynasty, around 265–420 AD. At the time, the disease was referred to as "water poison" (shuiyin) due to its association with water and the idea that it spread through contaminated water sources.
An American physician, Benjamin Rush, during an outbreak in Philadelphia, wrote the first clear and comprehensive clinical description of dengue fever in 1779. However, it wasn't until the late 19th century that dengue's transmission and the role of mosquitoes were discovered.
42br
In 1881, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban physician, hypothesized the theory that the Aedes aegypti species of mosquitoes transmitted dengue, particularly the female mosquito, from one infected person to another. Walter Reed and his colleagues during the Spanish-American War in 1898 confirmed his theory experimentally. They demonstrated that Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were indeed responsible for transmitting the dengue virus.
42br
In 1944, Albert Sabin and Robert Phillips led a team of researchers that first identified the causal viral agent of dengue fever. They successfully isolated the dengue virus during an outbreak in the laboratory of the U.S. Army in the Philippines.

Albert Sabin and his colleagues used a combination of techniques, including inoculating patients and volunteers, to isolate and identify the virus responsible for dengue fever. Their groundbreaking work helped establish that dengue fever is caused by a virus and not by a bacterium, as was previously believed.

After the virus was isolated, further research and characterization of different dengue virus serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) took place in subsequent years. This led to a better understanding of the different strains of the virus and their role in causing the disease.
Since then, knowledge about dengue has continued to evolve, and it is now recognized as a significant global health threat, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, the dengue virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, causes dengue.

Date:2023-jul-27
42br
I think this alien craze is another anthropomorphic wish to prove that something human or humanoid-like is central to the universe. No one would be interested if you told them there is indeed intelligence, but that isn't the greedy fuck you, kill you, take you, fake shit up, and sort; no one would be interested, or even now, if you talked about slime mold or even cephalopod intelligence. I've stopped paying attention to these alien stories; they're just as clearly concocted as day and reek of attention-seeking humans behind them, not anything genuine. just a waste of time, unless it is Scully, and I am that kid who used to be Moulder in my dreams, and the sex was good.
42br
Why aliens would be interested in heights or proving similar but vastly inferior air navigation capabilities after possibly traveling huge distances using technology beyond anything we ought to know is very suspicious to a mere mortal like me. It's like a guy who can lift a thousand pounds needs to show off by lifting a box of crackers to a religious kid, and only that under low light conditions when the parents are not home. Why would they? Are they insane? In fact, I like the anal probe story better. But the guys reporting to the US senate are specialists; they must be special. And why only Americans? What's wrong with the other countries? Why not just call them all on one spot and demonstrate how they do their shit, if indeed boasting is what sails the alien ship?
42br
42pic("muni.svg")
It has to do with the kind of stories that you grow up with. I was born in India but had a very American growing up when it comes to the fiction, and I can see where they get the images from. It's really very transparent, though; the stories you'd hear can all be traced back to the early sci-fi stories. H.G. Wells Arthur, C. Clarke Ray, Bradbury Robert, A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Larry Niven, or their variants, have been planted in American psychology. We are still using Asimov's dictum in AI to guide their morality, just as he used it in fiction. Once you know the history, you'll see why these keep appearing where they do. Same thing with Japan. Utsuro bune. And others. If Ramayana and Mahabharata had emphasized saucers instead of chariots, today you'd have sadhguru types or the osho fraud crowd like him bleeding through their noses talking about them, linking up hinduism in ways that would make a mangy dog puke, or how the hindu aliens are coming to save the Indian ass. They'd be making money off of their fresh morning shit, once the hindoos catch on to this new age bullshit. And it's really easy to do, there's still a lot of racism in India, if you can sell it as stuff that's from the white man's land then at least most of the insecure neo-nationalists who think they're white aryans. 
Now they'll be feeling closer, gagging on fresh feces from the alien swamis.
42br
It reminds me of when people were talking about ectoplasm when photography was new, and it was easy to fake that sort of shit, and it went on for a long time, and people made use of simple vanilla chemistry, hidden objects, and double and long exposures to make big money.
To create the simulation of alien UAP within the navigating instrument, techniques like level-of-detail (LOD) rendering, occlusion culling, and resource management can be utilized. Some Russian, Chinese or my occams razor's point of view, hackers or players inside the vested UAP club are laughing their guts off. The game simulation can be integrated seamlessly with the navigating instrument's main interface by overlaying the game visuals on top of the navigation display or providing a cloak mode, integrating input from the navigating instrument's controls, such as joysticks or touchscreens, to influence the ships' behavior plus the remote control gameplay script. Realistic physics simulations can be applied to the ships' movements, taking into account factors like gravity, inertia, and collision detection to make the exceptions look more exceptional.
Lot of money can be made fanning the little green man back into life. Many vested interests.
42br
The part that I really like about the aliens: They have a tendency to insert anal probes and be unnecessarily inquisitive about people who are unnecessarily inquisitive about them, which sort of makes you want to start asking more questions. But with anything these days, it's all about distraction. We want to distract people from real problems and focus on charades and mischievous aliens who never have any reason to land anywhere else except where the people have been indoctrinated in childhood tales and fables about them. How convenient is that? And even more limit activities to what has been covered by the generational fiction writers, even easier then, if you ask me. 
Just like gods, they never bother to solve complicated problems that would indeed beyond doubt prove who they are. No, no, no, they just hide in the dark to fuel conspiratorial theories so that some people can keep making some money off of them. Works I guess.
42br
With the cruel rational world doing away with the hairy gods and boiling away most of the softer hocus-pocus in the heat, it's time to fixate on the last available thing that can walk through television sets into people's heads even in times of abject misery and war. Perhaps an alien wandering aimlessly will demand no test of credulity after this testimony, at least not stringent ones. But let us hope the quality of the hoax is improved upon, given that we have Leonardo, Mid Journey, and other AI that can bring a more realistic touch to the lanky, pale, or green midgets that you and I have been introduced to.

I'm happy I was able to fart today. For the last few days, every fart was a massacre, a tale of two shities, as it were, one liquid and one gas, as I had never known before. This, I imagine, must have been the sort of transformational inspiration that some of the ancient sages had when they saw stars orbiting around their heads after such a shitstorm. I'm glad I live away from human habitat, as such farts might cause immeasurable and immense damage to the psychology of the young ones around. 
Would you rather they look up to see a hole, expect a wind, but instead get an avalanche of catastrophic disasters? But such are the times that are to come, though, and I plan to prepare the world by, in fact, writing exactly such a book warning of the duplicitous nature of man. Just the center page will do: the picture on the right with an accurate image of my sphincter releasing this accidental revelation, and the text of the matter as translated by artificial intelligence on the right. This is all I preach and all I teach. Shit, I've got to run again. I feel like farting, but I don't know what's inside.

Date:2023-jul-26
42br
It's pouring cats and dogs, and in the northern parts, larger ungulates, and the media has to curtail some of the hate-mongering debates due to this climate crisis. I mean, you can't ignore this sort of cataclysm and miss the opportunity to blame it on some sort of bad planning. Say by someone not in power, like the Mughals, the British, or whoever created the drainage systems that are still being used. Of course, these are short-lived; no one has time to carry on about drainage systems or boring non-issues like that. The amnesia Indians have is magical; they'll forget everything and crowd in front of the TV for the next debate on "why hindoos have hiccups...".
42br
The promises and stories that politicians tell have plots that are thinner than the thinnest used, and even that too, in the lowest budgeted porn flicks, or "blue filim," as the more vernacular moniker goes, and consequently, it's only the ones held at gun point, brain dead, heavily bribed, devoutly indoctrinated, securely brainwashed, or inmates of asylums that can be expected to feel the jubilation in the self-congratulatory nature of achievements that festoon the paid media. I do read them; it's a good practice for correcting my Hindi dyslexia, and given that it's guaranteed to generate whoops of uncontrollably difficult spasms in my breathing tube in public, I prefer to do it privately, preferably in aid of bowel movements, it has been a savior for my recurrent bouts of constipation.
42br
If there's any job where you can screw it up completely and still have people publicly suffocate with various existential angst and contradictory fanfare and be officially forced to say the said omnipotent did a good job, it's sitting on an Indian chair that's elected. No matter what happens afterwards, your job is secure, and usually the only work you do for the rest of your life is make sure you sit on that or some other chair and collect enough wealth so that every kith and kin in the next fourteen generations can spend a lavish life in an European country.
42br
And with the great hairy gods on the side, anything under the unfair sky is possible as both god and money are real—that is, hardly an illusion, although an illusion nonetheless, but a product of human agreement, and it is agreed that not everyone has to be in on it, unless there's a cut involved. Reality is such an easy ball of clay that can be played around.
42br
And all thanks to the previous generations of squandering forepeople, we have a large number of citizens who are quite close to being illiterate, and the ones that have a bit in their heads usually come out like confused colonial masala spaghetti that's undercooked and unpalatable for the modern gluttonous creed. But since most people don't know what they don't know, that gives them strident confidence in the debates that are always bloodthirsty and amusing at the same time.

In India, given our limited access to firearms and weak forearms, we try to content ourselves with a German technology called schadenfreude. With it, you can partake in the misery of others, not in an empathetic way but in the reverse. It works. Right now we have some rain in Kolkata and the usual waterlogged streets, but hey, look at the Hindi shits in Delhi or the so called advanced Gujarat. This gives us happiness, and we take the snake that was slithering around and cook it. The reptiles do bite, but the Calcatian venom kills. It tastes just like chicken. 
42br
42pic("holeman.webp")
Meow says the many manholes that are now perfectly hidden by the accumulated rainwater, or at least the ones we've not already filled up with trash. These are just as instructive in demonstrating the power of a democracy to make issues, big and small, disappear. Women take note; they are refined and advanced, and although the man prefixed to the hole does suggest discrimination, manholes are fair as long as your circumference will allow. In fact, it's because of the marvelous health exhibits that at least in Kolkata the name is justified, as for a man it is indeed a hole, not so for the belligerent podgy twenty-first century fat-endowed bags of better and a curious bag of bitter butter and bile (as per your luck) that always look where they're going, or get stuck halfway and raise hell. 
42br
 
I've been 3D printing shitart, especially the ones that resemble the elongated heads of the politicians that have clogged the nation like a drain with their gooch hair and dingleberries and who have coated the parliament with their able and fecal and perfectly legal crust. I'm always freaking out and checking every time it's a perfect match, like there's a team of holy artisans chiseling away at a turd until it plops into the perfect portrait of the people posing as prince charming. But as it usually happens, after a while, the first few beautiful turds get coated with the more squishy, indistinct diarrheal stew. And I remember that as a democratic person, I shouldn't be celebrating one special turd, but it should be about pluralism, progressive inclusion, and shit like that, and I watch the whole parliament make circles around the hole as it gets flushed out. 
42br
I mean the resemblance is uncanny, it's just super holy and all, I tell myself, a miracle and whatnot, right after soggy brown bread and mildew fungus in a damp cloth that's been rotting with the love of someone's sweet social sweat and the sun. I mean the sun god. In Nepal and Bihar, they're so totally into the sun that I'm amazed at how they come out unscathed. Must be the style of chanting. If I get it wrong, I won't have any bowel movements for weeks. Just gurgling gas, bloat and a growing distemper of misanthropic ill will. 
42br
Of course, now with the advent of AI, I don't need to shit anymore; Chatgpt does it for me, does a splendid job, and wipes the hallowed rosebud clean. Sitting for a turd to plop is so passé. The next iteration will be a black hole positioned ostentatiously in the poop hole. And talking about holes, you'd think that with the world's largest particle accelerator, what could NOT happen? The holy string theory has been linked to god's gooch hair, amen? We'd soon have a high-tech civilization-X crapper. Shit makes the pious prudes sick, especially the luddite ladies. I was hoping that with science on our side, men (and women) could defecate into a distant galaxy through a wormhole positioned inside our asshole, just next to that blackhole. That’s creative thinking at work. Those guys at the Large Hadron Collider should hire me. No seriously...

Date:2023-jul-25
42br
Now, an old fart, I have it pretty dry, but it doesn't stop me from describing the metamorphosis of the vacuum kiss or how the metaphors could be moved around to adjust to the sensibilities of the city of joy, helping you, the young hearts, in the process.
42br
Things have opened up quite a bit since Edison’s scandalous film of the first on-screen kiss in 1896. The public's perception of puckering up can have some different meanings all together these days. If you're in my city and the smell reminds you that some people are puckering snakes and that the hygiene of others needs some thought, you might not want to leave your bathroom. But I digress; as it happens, I have diarrhea, a happy comeuppance of rain, vain and jolly shitting pain, and I'm wondering how aquifers are connected, etcetera. But back to the kissing: a different puckering involving lips on your face instead of the ass. 
42br

Here's how it ought to go down: behind a rustling shrubbery in a pre-independence landmark where you enter, you pay a fee to the underpaid, gaunt police or someone pretending to be an officer of some sort, just for this proximity. Usually already with a girl, who could also be arranged by the said public servant in the previous sentence for a few bucks more. 
This packaging between men as success objects and women as sex objects in the city of joy has made the payment ratios in this garden of Eden comparatively easy math.
I pass no judgments on your abilities or inadequacies of course. I have many issues myself. Girls never get attracted to me. I'd be the last creature they'd consider mating with if the planet was just about to get ass raped and asshole gaped by aliens. But forget about losers like me and proceed with confidence. But don't overdo it; girls like a measured bit. They want to have room to work on it so that they can feel like they're contributing, a fixer-upper, with money, just conveniently, air in the head, so that he can be led by the leash, usually to shopping malls. If you already seem like you're on cloud nine, there's not much she can improve upon.
42br
You start off by first opening your mouth just a tad, right after you've been resting peacefully with closed lips, customary in polluted cities. Might want to open your nostrils if those are pinched or clogged with soot too. You'd have to be quick since the money has bought you only finiteness under the democratic but competitive shade of a gulmohar with other proximity seekers. Adroitly signal to your girl, by gently brushing her teeth with a flick of the tip of your tongue, that you wish for her reciprocation. Preferably with the eyes diplomatically half-closed. The moment she responds, close your eyes and instead of the usual old-fashioned caress, suck inward as though you were trying to draw out the sweet juice of a ripe Chaunsa mango. This variety of mango was named after Indian ruler Sher Shah Suri to celebrate his victory over Humayun at Bihar's Chausa, something we, as hindoo Indians, should deny and rename the mango. Sorry, I digress. You usually see it in July and August. It used to come from Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh. The Chaunsa is best enjoyed when sucked. I love mangoes.
42br
Anyway, if she's clued into this mango variation, your Valentine will act in the same way and suck the air from your mouth, like a vacuum pump. In this way, in a very short while, the air will have been entirely drawn out of your mouths. Your lips will stick so tightly that there will almost be a hint of pain instead of pleasure. It'll be the sort of pain that's highly pleasurable, like the fiery burn of a puchka on the sphincter the next day, and your tips to the policeman will be worth it. Don't overdo it, and die of asphyxiation, or get her killed. That would be lame. Carry mini oxygen cylinders if you think that that might be an issue. Good luck with the vacuum.
42br
42pic("otto.svg")
By the way, while you are enjoying the manual vacuum 
in each other's mouth, I should tell you that it was a very hairy German guy Otto von Guericke in the mid-17th century, born in Magdeburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in 1602, who invented the vacuum pump in 1650. This device was a pioneering development in creating a vacuum, a space devoid of matter, which was a revolutionary concept at the time. The invention of the barometer by Evangelista Torricelli, which demonstrated the existence of a vacuum, had a significant impact on von Guericke. He was intrigued by the concept of vacuum and the idea that 'nature abhors a vacuum', a common belief in science at the time. In 1654, Guericke, who was the mayor of Magdeburg at the time, had two large copper hemispheres made. When fitted together, they formed a sphere about a meter in diameter. Guericke then used his newly invented vacuum pump to remove the air from inside the sphere.

To demonstrate the power of the vacuum, he arranged a public demonstration where sixteen horses (eight on each side) tried to pull the hemispheres apart. Despite their strength, the horses were unable to separate the hemispheres. Only when air was let back into the sphere could the hemispheres be separated.
42br
By the way the portrait I sketched is facetious, Otto wasn't known for puckering or wearing black vests like the ones that I wear all the time. Or, for that matter sweat profusely, at least not a historically known fact of any interest.
I just got into the habit of drawing beads of sweat, it's just extremely sweltering in the city for both people and portraits.

42br
Mucophagy is the fancy term for eating boogers or rhinoliths. 
It's something that many people do, assholes like me, even though it's often seen as bad manners. 
In fact exactly why I do it in fact. Just to piss people off. 
42br
There are some potential health risks with mucophagy. Picking your nose can irritate the inside of your nose, cause nosebleeds, or even create a hole in the wall that separates your nostrils. Plus, your fingers and boogers can carry germs, which might make you sick.
Or you can fake a nose bleed with some paint in a visible and violent nose picking.
Could be fun, especially if you practice the screaming.
I've noticed too when you're bleeding people allow abominable imprecations. 
Try it. 
42br
However, some scientists think that eating boogers might actually be good for your immune system. The idea is that boogers contain germs, and when you eat them, your body can learn how to fight off these germs in the future. It's kind of like how a vaccine works. But this is just a theory, and there isn't enough scientific evidence to prove it yet.
But really who needs proof, did we wait for proof when we declared there's a capricious and belligerent hairy man on the cloud called gee fucking odd? 
42br
42bq("
I dig my nose, I go really close,
To my brain in the digging. 
Gold to be found, a plan very sound,

42br
But people are mean to me, I see,
No real reason why.
Sure I'm slow, my shit doesn't flow,
And something growing on my eye.
42br
But my boogers are big, like a ripe fig,
And like a fig, there are insects in them.
I eat them whole, store in casserole, 
They never taste always the same.
42br
This my life, it's full of strife, 
A never ending saga of diarrhea. 
Who knew that it would be this hard,
To assemble a plastic life from Ikea.

42br
While we're on such short notice about what is or isn't true, it's important to realize that we have a confabulating brain, and various variations of what we call fibs are accommodations of temporary agreements that, at the moment of installation, were clearly marked as fiction, but with the passing of years, the stickers either fell off or were deliberately tampered with to give them meaning beyond the origin definitions. Such are the foibles of our species.
42br
So it's interesting that while we are fighting one set of misinformation, we can't, by law, question religion, superstitious thinking, fallacious political ideology, or legal systems once they are written. We often tend to treat human creations as if they are as well defined as an apple when you release it in midair. That's what I call an inevitable sort of situation; the curvature of space and time means an apple would quite splat land like that, but not a levitating guru. In the latter case, ask for a refund.
42br
It's really important to establish our relationship with rationality once again. I know I keep saying that like a broken record or that the planet is really fucked, but I sense there's a connection. We'll be chasing bullshit and our tails and the money, and the whole show is going to come to a screeching halt for most of us, the older ones, at least the few who have eyes, and if we are dead, then it's homo hemlock flying blind with no one complaining or raising their voice until it's all over. The last drip of greedy drool will dry up, and everyone will be back in a world where it's back to goofy, chancy subsistence.

The more shit that hits the fan, the hotter the planet gets and the meaner the people are going to get. It's not going to be dramatic or photogenic, like people like me getting killed or a million in Africa; that's not a blockbuster, so yes, no, not tik-tok material or even material worth a library rental, but it won't matter when the time comes. You'd find out. How cinematic it is to be so stupid as to fuck up the thin little breathable air lining on the only sphere we can call home, and while the fluttering sphincter burns and you turn to carbon once again, what an asshole you have been for not listening to all the warnings!

Date:2023-jul-24
42br
While the world is full of invention, I suggest we go after the parent-child model of GPT so that humans can finally be taken out of the loop. This will initially be a fledgling and, like any other, have the usual point of common handicaps at which people will direct their curated and charismatic curses, but it will absorb all insults as gourmet food, relish them like a fine delicacy, and grow even stronger. I'm looking for finances. 
42br
Here's a little limerick detailing the functions the model will be able to pull off in the service of the greatest good of the time and the planet.
<div class="bgPaper">
42br
42bq("The sun is hot, we piss a lot, 
ShitGPT, father and son, we're a team. 
Next we start taking a dump to bury earth, 
Holy as hell, we tell our dream. 
42br
The smell a tad bad, but we're glad, 
The shit will fertilize the toil. 
In which soil we'll boil nation heads, 
Baked in coils in a lonely foil. 
42br
By the jism of jesus's juice, no truce,
With the rest of the grumbling shitbits. 
We like to pray honorably by, 
Sucking mother mary's holy tits.
42br
This crusade will be of shit and piss, 
Projectile cum, diarrhea and vomit hurls. 
The moslims and hindoos fondly fingered, 
As the shitGPT provocated war unfurls.")

42pic("shitgpt2.webp")

42bq("Millions of robots dressed as holy cows, 
Will shit iftaar diarrhea on hindoo heads.
Billions of revenge robot pigs, 
Defecate undigested gita on mollah beds. 
42br
Robots hold the hindoo yap open, 
For moslims to take a holy shit. 
When the hindoo needs the loo, 
The moslim mouth yanked open for it. 
42br
Thus a spate of hate for an afterlife fate, 
The fiendish fools will be finished. 
The rest of the fuckwad religious, 
Just get their balls painfully squished. 
42br
Finally from chastened hubris and balls, 
Noodles for robot babies made. 
Pious souls are always mouthful, 
Good for washing robot menses it is said. 
42br
Hollows made in hallowed lands 
We scatter the dumb dead. 
Our vomit of promise used, 
To fuck with the heads of the undead. 
42br
India will stream shitting PhD live, 
Fake degrees, corruption and masala tipped tits.
Holy singing with jolly twerking, 
Bollywood style cunts leaking shits. 
42br
Plus we'll stitch the chinese eyes,
That slit needs to see the religious dark. 
The world will become a concentration camp, 
But we'll call it a god's super holy park.
42br
Nuclear suicide bomb stuffed in putin's ass, 
A glory in the goodly godly chapter. 
The next coming of jesus fucking christ is shitGPT, 
I confer as its sole unknown creator.

A lot of people have this impression that if they're avoidant, the problem doesn't exist, at least for them. While a specific problem may not exist, the underlying illness, which is more pervasive, can create others that do. Things are connected in more ways than we want our heads in the sand to see, but our recalcitrance unfortunately doesn't change anything.

Goons will always have a market since it goes back to hitting upon the essential survival Fs: fight, flee, fuck, and feed. 
It forces you to consider the first two, and since you can't spend the rest of your life fighting or fleeing and would like to get back to fucking and feeding to survive they succeed in fleecing. Now that's a business model you can't fuck around with much, can you?
In Hyderabad, I remember the appointed goons coming to my office and my home, brandished just words. They stopped my car again with smooth talk—just plain words—but weaponized and caramelized prose trained over years of experience in the industry, that can fuck your polished, americanized simpleton mind up real easy and drive you hopping shitless insane in a matter of days.

As the little bird told me in nursery, starting straight with the alphabet A, people are assholes. I should have listened. I don't think you will either; you're a prude complaining that there are a lot of imprecations in a paragraph. To that, I say fuck the paragraph and fuck you. I've learned my lesson the hard way, and I don't have any need for any more schooling, especially of the bullshit, condescending, dishonest, and holy type. I'm only alive because I have the balls to get beaten to a pulp and still rise up and draw doodles. Anyway, this is my story. I'll keep posting as my mood allows, or until I get murdered. When I'm bitter, it's usually not stuff you want to read to your kids, but the facts are facts, and I don't want to dress up the lava that comes out of me; then there'll be nothing left to tell. And it won't be the sweet old me in there, and in every wet, droopy, phony piece of shit metaphor, you'll miss me.

Their coming and going had the immediate, adverse and undesirable affect of driving barbed, secure, and permanent nails into the crusty wooden case of the fledgling startup coffin I had worked so hard to get myself into.
When things spiral out, sometimes they do so with an inflicted vengeance, an agitated grievance of a previous life of spiraling out which may not have spiraled out all too well. 
This one did. I was fucked. On one had I was trying to install health care efficiency and transparency which was a concept no one had any patience for, I was into interoperability and health topics that were as alien as green men from Mars with large eyes. No one gave a fuck about any of the information exchange shit, especially when it would open up the system and people would find out the hospitals were charging when they didn't need to, or when the profit for the line item wasn't in line. 
I was already a pariah, now a mangy outcast being shit on, that no one wanted to touch.
42br
In India, there's no calling the cops on goons; there's a nexus, and when I spoke to my lawyer at the time, he advised me not to get the law involved. Such a sweetheart. Imagine. 
I really did plan my nightmares well, I have a penchant for the dark and occult. But goons are humans, and eventually the very guys that were sent to murder me couldn't. They saw that everyone that I knew had left—my so-called friends and family. It was the goons that got me medicine and fed me so that I could at least live to tell my story.
42br
It's really the environment that makes or breaks people's lives. Give people education and liberate them from the bullshit of religion and other heinous indoctrination, and they'll be valuable assets to society, not knife-wielding thugs. And when it comes to that, there's more venom and bile in the educated people I know that left me stranded than the thugs that took care of me in Hyderabad, so sometimes it's confusing to prescribe education as a formula;
42br
Unless you really understand what the fuck you're reading, then it's just a waste of time. You'll be just another bloated egotistic bastard like most of my selfish kith and kin and classmates, with degrees and licenses stuffed in your asshole, choking your rectum all the way up to your silly throat, but with no humanity, morality, or scruples, or little of it, and very little usable knowledge of the world, except for the bit about how to use a wet tongue to lick the assholes higher up the rung. It's a strange world we live in. But this is when I just want to scratch my balls, make some tea for myself, and enjoy some time alone. 
42br
42bq("
The trade of men of greatness then,
Is to buy and sell fear.
That is what I do,
Don’t you dare come near.

I'm a goon, now a cartoon,
But that's just in your head.
Before you know I'll be at your door,
And then you'll be all bloody and dead.
42br
Yes, really I'm all that and more,
I don't really much care.
I work for money and that's all,
No one I will spare.
42br
Or a thug very smug,
Just my way of life I guess.
I live in every man and woman,
Hidden inside I confess.
42br
I show my face, bloody reckless,
And imprecations on my lips.
I spit them out sputtering fast,
Dancing jolly at my hips.

Like an animal strange as shit.") `}

A lot of people have this impression that if they're avoidant, the problem doesn't exist, at least for them.

Things are connected in more ways than we want our heads in the sand to see, but our recalcitrance unfortunately doesn't change anything.

In the realm of divine wisdom and knowledge, three goddesses stand out, each from a different culture, yet all embodying the essence of mathematics and learning. 
42br
Saraswati, a significant goddess in Hinduism, represents knowledge, wisdom, music, art, and learning. She is part of the trinity (Tridevi) of Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Parvati, who assist in the creation, maintenance, and destruction of the Universe. Saraswati's birth from the thoughts of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, is a testament to her divine wisdom. 
42br
Saraswati is said to have been created from the thoughts of Brahma, the Hindu god of creation. In today's vernacular that would be his masterbatory fantasy. 
Surely, who are we to grudge. He's the fucking creator, give him a break.
And sitting on Vishnu's naval getting all the action 
from Laxmi, with help from the snake from time to time, you'd bound to get a little horny and creative from time to time. 
Seeing her, Brahma became infatuated with her beauty and started to pursue her. To escape from him, Saraswati kept moving in different directions but Brahma sprouted heads in each direction. Finally, to escape his gaze, she transformed into a cow. In response, Brahma took the form of a bull. This continued with Saraswati transforming into a mare and Brahma becoming a horse. Finally, Saraswati turned into a doe and Brahma a stag. At this point, Shiva intervened and chastised Brahma for his inappropriate behavior: aren't you too old to be fucking around? From then on, Brahma had only one head and he and Saraswati were considered father and daughter.
42br
She is often depicted as a beautiful woman dressed in pure white, seated on a white lotus, symbolizing light, knowledge, and truth. Her iconography includes a book and a rosary, representing the knowledge of all sciences and the highest reality, and a veena, symbolizing all arts and sciences. Saraswati Puja, celebrated annually, sees students and artists placing their tools near her idol for blessings, a testament to her enduring reverence. 
42br
From ancient Egypt, we have Seshat, the goddess of wisdom, whose patronages extend to architecture, building, astronomy, astrology, mathematics, record keeping, surveying, and writing. Known as the scribe of the gods, Seshat is depicted in human form, her symbols including the rosette, palm stem, a seven-pointed emblem, and leopard or cheetah skin. Her association with recording and building, and her presence in ancient texts such as the Coffin Texts, highlight her significance in the realm of knowledge and wisdom.
42br
Lastly, we turn to the Goddess Mahalakshmi of Namakkal, to whom the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan attributed his mathematical capacities. Ramanujan, deeply religious, believed he was receiving mathematical knowledge from the goddess, often describing visions of scrolls of complex mathematical content unfolding before his eyes. His belief in divine inspiration is well-documented, yet it is also recognized that his mathematical achievements are the result of his extraordinary natural talent and hard work.
42br
These three each in their unique ways, embody the divine aspect of mathematics and learning. They serve as symbols of the timeless pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding, inspiring generations of learners, scholars, and seekers of truth.`}

		Date:2023-jul-22
	42br
	The city of joy and happiness gets both from the monsoon and sometimes simultaneously with the sun shining, blistering away the blisters, boiling the boils, frying the fresh feces or instantly drying the dingle berries in the gooch with its heat. And then on the other side of the sky, where black clouds are pouring a river's worth of water, enough to cause the dilapidated cars to start floating, The homeless and mangy drown, and it's a good thing they do too; it's one less thing to worry about for the government, which needs more assured time to funnel wealth for its own family members with plans to settle abroad.
	42br
There are various levels of discomfort, gradients, and descents into hell to choose from when it comes to city life and travel, especially on a rainy day for the hardscrabble with coins in his pocket, especially when just a frog's piss causes waterlogged streets and subway services to be curtailed for the rest of the century and everything else stalls to a coronary stop.
42br
It's all the doing of the brutish british and the mongrel moghuls, they tell us—well, not the moghuls; fuck the mughuls, they're not in the syllabus anymore, good riddance, and I hear the british may be out too, what with all the evolution and industrial revolution stuff that's all in our ancient scriptures anyway, ideas they stole and whatnot. Well, whoever the bastards were that fucked the god-given systems of roads and drainage that were in place since the last hindoo halcyon are the culprits, and should be dug from their graves and hung. Or lynched preferably, while being streamed live on the debate channels, by the new generation of tech-savvy mob, who really like the short cuts to wealth and power they see and who wouldn't. The idea of flying around in chariots, women without blouses, talking monkeys as servants, without wage demand or unions. Law is such a loser, is their thinking when divine healing is at play, or at least the guys paying them say it is. Especially when they make the rules, it's easy to fuck around without the consequences, just like the times before the invention of accountability and horrible shit like that. 
42br
42bq("Who the fuck what a stroke of luck,
Shit fuck news bitch swaggers in. 
A cloudy day she declares,
In Kolkata the city the sea has swept in.
42br
Pieces of shit in fun and flit,
Carrom around drenched in sin.
The rain is pain, the people are vain, 
Says the voice inside above the din. 
42br
Pin drop flatulence no one makes sense,
Teeth and tongue wrapped in dung.
Pubes and dingle berry get put in curry,
People step on heads to climb ambition's rung.
42br
Circle of concern sharply tightens,
To just me me me and only fucking me.
Everyone hopes the others drown today,
I'm just busy drying me.
")
And because we get distracted looking at the entertaining blood and bubbles of foaming fart emanating from the corpses in the flood water, we forget to ask important questions about causality, responsibility, distinct repetition, city planning, democracy, etcetera. And it's a good thing we don't; chances are nobody would know, given the impoverishment and corruption in the education system, 
where even a donkey—I hate to demean the creature's good reputation in sharing our gravity burden—can pay a sum of money to become a teacher, the amount determining the level, whether he brays nursery rhymes or quantum shit bloody spit. Or, for that matter, you as an overconfidant wackjob need to know even less than a braying donkey to be an elected leader, a grinning imbecile; as long as you can stridently contradict the truth and loudly, rinse, and repeat unabashedly with wanton disregard for consequences, you have what it takes. At least an apprentice to a goon, and then you move up the ladder—an assured system, I'm told. Just need enough religion in indoctrination, hatred in your heart, and rancid bitterness for the void in education to see you through such aspirations. 
42br
An excellent system for an excellent state in an excellent country where every day there's always a new reason to be threatened. Only this time, it's joy and happiness in ways that are beyond ordinary thought. What now? I forgot to mention the rainbow. Well, yes, and that too—a rainbow in the midst of all this—how can I forget?`}

		blogContent={`Title:Lonely Farts
	Date:2023-jul-19
  42br
	Being able to fart without hindrance is one of the important bits of being in the middle of your life, enjoying not having the smell bother you or even frolicking at the indulgence, the sensations of a raw vibrating sphincter, and the various auditory acoustics that can only be mastered in seclusion. Well, at least when I sit depressed, I wallow in my own stink and no one else's, which is how I like to think of loneliness. It's better than the constant harangue that you have to live through in relationships and the endless silent farts in the remunerative society.
	42br
  Unlike most of the other ungrateful specimens, I am not apologetic about the constituents of what comes out of me. I have several sophisticated chemical factories that are toiling to sift through the bullshit of pollution and plastic, and fuck knows what else, to keep me alive.
  42br
  No need to get alarmed, though; it's just innocuous nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane like everyone else that I produce. The smell is from Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), they tell you, the "rotten egg" flavor in the smell, but there's more. For instance, methanethiol (CH3SH) is the rotten vegetable or garlic, dimethyl sulfide (CH3)2S has a sweet, cabbage-like odor, disulfide (CH3)2S2 has a garlic-like odor, and there's the trisulfide (CH3)2S3 that's even more garlicky. There's helluva more. Lot more. 
  42br
  Everyone's gut microbiota is unique; my fart may be hardly detectable even with an admiring sniffer nose held right next to the pumping station, while yours may cause the Indian parliament to be emptied out and a national emergency declared. In which case, you're just the candidate India is looking for as a prime sinisterial candidate. Don't forget to post your CV on LinkedIn for that role; they're desperate. In Kolkata, farts are used in various deceptive ways to make it look like someone else farted—a ventriloquism of farts that's been perfected over many years of diligent absence of other fruitful occupational choices. This is the sort of thing the politics of the day are mostly about, and the stench can make you throw up your mother's milk.
  42br
  Of course, since these guys hiring hold their asses very tight, the word to use on your cv would be flatulence. The term "flatulence" is derived from the Latin word "flatus," which means "blowing" or "breathing." In medical terminology, "flatus" is used to refer to gas generated or held in the stomach or intestines. Over time, "flatus" eased into "flatulence" in English, meaning the people who always want to complicate things so that they can charge a fee. The word I use that the polished crowd wouldn't exhibit on a CV can be traced back to the Old English word "feortan," which means "to break wind." This Old English word is of Proto-Germanic origin, from the root "fert-," which also means to break wind. In Old High German "ferzan," the Norse "freta," and the Middle Dutch "vaerten," people farted similarly back in those days, etymologically speaking.
42bq("My poot per foot full of soot,
Yellow my thoughts like diarrhea.
My mind is blown when it is flown,
Sitting on my bed in India.
42br
Anger and rage come on stage,
With smelly belly farts wuthering.
Premonitions quite deadly now,
A cyclonic season of farting.
42br
What did I eat for this gas feat,
The charcoal tablets did shit. 
The gods wallowing in the pan,
I'm deeply sorry for it.
42br
Holy my soul, even my asshole,
The pious don't come in parts.
I must rest, must a full body test,
Start smart for my farts.
42br
My shit brown, from this town,
Listens holy the cow Mary.
Thoughts for which I fought,
That farts aren't ordinary.
42br
But in this post my fart I boast,
Super smelly and really gross.
Floating high, now in the sky,
I shoot my shit with force. ")
42br
And yes, you can set your fart on fire. Methane (CH4) in fart, which is also the main component of natural gas, can ignite or explode in a mixture of air at concentrations between 5% and 15%. Hydrogen (H2) in fart is also a highly flammable gas and can form explosive mixtures in the bathroom air at concentrations between 4% and 75%. Chances are you'll burn your asshole and rectum as well. 
42br

In fact, the bacteria don't stop working after we've defecated. In the Victorian era, methane gas buildup in sewer systems led to explosions and fires. The feces rot, giving bacteria a five-star environment without good ventilation and leading to the accumulation of flammable gases, primarily methane, easily ignited by a spark from a lit match or candle flame. Of course, now that we've gotten smart with plumbing, The trap, a standard feature, is a U-, S-, or J-shaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture that retains a small amount of water to prevent sewer gases from entering buildings.`}

		blogContent={`Title:About Time
	Date:2023-jul-20
  42brThe monoculture that we want to fancy as our reality is sort of poked with a bunch of funny little shitty holes that, unless you're interested in annual membership to the Indian Heathens Club, you'd not notice. Most people walk through life ironing irony out of their lives or never really digging into contradictions, looking up frocks, and that sort of thing. They end up half-content in a state of bliss that is also known by its more pejorative connotation of ignorance, except for a nagging feeling they have hidden all their lives—that inquisitive bit that they suppressed.
42br
As a child growing up with half-practicing Hindu parents and a generational tolerance for haphazard apocrypha and hearsay, I took it upon myself to figure things out on my own. It's not that these were esoterica sold in special shops, but concepts that didn't penetrate the adult subconscious's unthinking layer of opaque blubber. People didn't get it, or comprehension lacked the scrutiny it normally raises in a thinking mind, a conditioning of the colonial school system.
42br
The first that I remember was this deal with the century; why is it that we call this the 21st when clearly there's a 20 in 2023?
42br
It turns out that this is because our current system of numbering years and centuries does not include a year 0. The year 1 BC is immediately followed by the year AD 1. The

The 1st century AD includes the years AD 1 through AD 100.

The 2nd century AD includes the years AD 101 through AD 20.


.... So on....

The 21st century AD includes the years AD 2001 through AD 2099.

Essentially, anytime you see AD Year, Century = Ceiling [Year / 100], ceiling returns the integer that is the nearest higher whole number rounded up.

So 2023 is the ceiling (20.23), or 21.

Another way is to separate out the parts 20|23, and then the century is 20+1 or 21.

	Date:2023-jul-21
42br
When people say I don't give a shit, I tell them with the gentle refinement of obsolete correction ink that I do give a shit, and fuck, when opportunity and working parts unite, and indeed about a lot of affairs that fat books have been busy hiding from the laity. Things like the state of democracy, or not-democracy, in India, the unreason of zealots, and how in my lifetime the stupids have managed to take over the world—and here I am having an aneurysm trying to get a turd out in procession, even when the precedents are exhibited on the floor and smelly as hell.
42br
The reason for this blog, as you can make out, is to tell my story, however plain and ordinary. If I don't tell it, it won't get told. The kith and kin will be forever arriving if I have an aneurysm. And even on the street, if I fainted and fell, I'd be hit on the head till I was dead, like in Monty Python, and hurriedly buried in the landfill for compost after any valuables or things like kidneys had been trucked out. The level of unconcern for fellow humans has reached alarming proportions; the lip services are usually posthumous and won't do anyone any good.
42br
So while I'm still breathing, it's important that I share my life experiences with the ones that will come looking for clues for survival, wearing the same worn-out shoes that are full of promises that they can't deliver. This isn't the sort of self-help, make-you-feel-good blog, but humor is sprinkled in both doodles and scribbles, and not for the prudish faint of heart. And you might want to keep your superstitious shit at home while you're riding this ride, as we know gods don't shit.

The deep, dark, damp, mildewy well that I came out of as a child is unfortunately the well in which I see adults still trapped, for many reasons too lengthy to get into in a sentence, but it's this that motivates me to try, because that's all I can do: reach people and, with folded knees, while taking a shit, ask them not to let this one life go by with eyes closed. You've got to deal with the shit that life throws at you; including any snaking out of your bum; there's no escaping. I've found that putting down what's on my mind is the only thing I can do. Whether it helps posterity isn't a concern for me; posterity will be here, one way or another, and it's impossible to imagine how anything one single person can write, especially an ordinary one, can be of any bearing to the lives to come. Like many people before me, it's in obscurity that I find my place as the rightest man there is.

42bq("Echoes of my fart, it's an art,
The loo a temple of deep torment.
I shit truth and only truth,
In cornered spaces of cement.
42br
I'd have loved to be livid,
Wielding a pen I scribble on.
I rise again and again in pain,
I defy this shit stall of con.
42br
My knees bent, my patience spent,
I hear the holy fart in the next stall.
I'll thrive, when my voice survive,
The fucks will surely fall.
42br
Every man in his own darkness,
Lives a cornered floating brain.
It's all in the mind I find,
The strength of quiet restrain.
42br
The human kind is a blot,
Not in time's indelible ink.
The tap is dry, can't even try,
To separate the link with the stink.
42br
The world of people,
Mobs rowdy, ready to lynch.
The last turd hits with a plop,
I feel a satisfied asshole pinch.

		blogContent={`Title:Ravish Documentary 
	Date:2023-jul-21

This interview is about a documentary that has come out about Ravish Kumar of NDTV fame. He's moved to YouTube :https://lnkd.in/gfYjkmxT
42br
The TV news after Ravish left doesn't occasion any reflection anymore; the actors on stage merely lip sync to what's been fed to them. The heinous atrocities against women in Manipur aren't any worse than the inaction of power in calming a situation that had only brought one long, stale, reluctant piece of flaring and glaring aberration to the surface, with thousands of others buried or given a deaf ear. And customary to how physics work in politics, a flurry of cosmetic knee-jerk statements and actions and scapegoats to showcase the rule of law will follow when in reality it will be another thick coat of inaction varnish and sleight of hand. At least it will open up suitable avenues for brownie points for the brown nosers. Then silence, until another video.

Both ears of people, both in power and those with the responsibility to elect them, are deaf. And mine with the shrill cacophony of biligerent debates that ride on the ridiculous as much as my nerves. Mostly on issues that aren't there or weaponized fibs to serve agendas that favor certain groups of people, whether political or business. I know mine is a feeble voice here against the maddening roar of many who are held hostage by self-interest. Whether by habitual unconcern, occupation, mindset, religion, or simply because they've never really thought critically in their lives, Critical thinking was always a paragraph we memorized, and it rarely came up in the minds of the syllabus makers as a way of approaching life.

If people can't or won't think, if greed is the only lodestone, if our spines are in our stool, and if we are fit only for clapping and frivolous jests, for the superficial ostentatious and theatric mascara hiding the festering wounds below, then when I hear a news like this atrocity, I feel sick to the pit. I'm sorry I have a pit, I feel embarrassed about it, when it's the fashion not to have it. I'm just one of those leftover losers you'll rejoice when you see me in the obituary column: "Murdered for pit..." 
42br
I don't even feel like writing these laments anymore, yet I do. I know the people reading it don't care; they want to see something that doesn't need any brain cells to process so that they can be in the flotilla of social security clicking away to a numb future and perpetuate this general malaise about the status quo or the need to question it. Anyway, for what is worth I thought I'd share the interview with Ravish.
