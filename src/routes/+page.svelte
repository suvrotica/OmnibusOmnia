	I couldn't just flippantly say a scratchpad of thoughts, extension of my gorilla head, unrelated
	figments strewn around, collectibles from the waste basket, or, more crudely, everything about
	anything. But that's exactly what I always wanted my blog to be. I'm not a prisoner to the usual
	boundaries that limit most people, and I wanted a place where people like me could find a way to
	read my thoughts and share their own.

<p>
	In Latin, "Omnibus" is a dative plural form of "omnis," meaning "all" or "every." In this context,
	It implies "for all." "Omnia" is the nominative or accusative neuter plural form of "omnis."
	meaning "all things" or "everything." Thus, "Omnibus Omnia" translates to "For Everyone, About
	Anything." And that satisfies the nerd inside me. A pompous name for something that could have
	otherwise been ignored as a trifle.
</p>
<p>
	Omnibus Omnia is thus intended as a universal melting pot of information, ideas, and, if I'm
	allowed big words, wisdom! In this wide-ranging consortium, the limit is only the ever-expanding
	horizon of your imagination. encompasses every conceivable topic and field of inquiry as a beacon
	of diverse and inclusive discourse. Here, you are free to explore the vast realms of human
	knowledge, like Tennyson's Ulysses and his mariners, sharing and receiving insights on a platform
	that respects and celebrates our shared quest for understanding. It is a realm where expertise
	meets curiosity, where questions spark dialogue, and where the answers always lead to more
	thrilling journeys. So whether you're a seasoned scholar or a curious fresher, an artist or a
	scientist, a dreamer or a pragmatist, join us and contribute to the infinite mosaic of collective
	wisdom. Welcome to Omnibus Omnia, the place for everyone to talk about anything.

<pre class="poem">
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we areâ€”
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
