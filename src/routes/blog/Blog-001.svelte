  <article class="poem" >You must know, you can't be slow,
<br>Got that huge ass horn to toot. <br>
Otherwise they think you're not,<br>
Even worth a fucking smelly poot.
<br><br>
Nobody really cares what you know,<br>
And by now you ought to see.<br>
The race of men want their ass licked,<br>
Paid as a slave, eat shit crumbs free.
<br><br>
It's just our species that has it's head,<br>
Right and tight and way inside its ass.<br>
Ants and many others cooperate,<br>
Swarm intelligence is another class.<br><br>

No ant a prude, can't call them rude,<br>
Their language we don't really know.<br>
Euphemistic superlative shit don't us fit,<br>
Sissy slaves with balls that need to grow.
